# MachineHack: Melanoma Tumor Size Prediction
***

### Problem Statement
Melanomas present in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. That’s why it’s tricky to provide a comprehensive set of warning signs. Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of the skin pigment melanin. The UV light may be from the sun or other sources, such as tanning devices.
The task for the competitors is to predict the melanoma tumor size based on various attributes.

### Dataset Description
* **mass_npea**:  the mass of the area understudy for melanoma tumor
* **size_npear**: the size of the area understudy for melanoma tumor
* **malign_ratio**: ration of normal to malign surface understudy
* **damage_size**: unrecoverable area of skin damaged by the tumor
* **exposed_area**: total area exposed to the tumor
* **std_dev_malign**: standard deviation of malign skin measurements
* **err_malign**: error in malign skin measurements
* **malign_penalty**: penalty applied due to measurement error in the lab
* **damage_ratio**: the ratio of damage to total spread on the skin
* **tumor_size**: size of melanoma_tumor

### Evaluation metric
The submission will be evaluated using the RMSE (root mean squared error) metric.

### Result
#### No.of registered: 302
#### Rank: 1
